# Territory Mapper

This is a demonstration page to show how the JavaScript canvas can be used to draw custom territories. The mapper displays dynamic address count for each respective territory drawn. Each territory can be refined along the borders and territories may be split as well as combined. 

**Note:** *Territory Mapper is a demo app and is missing many of the components of the full application*
